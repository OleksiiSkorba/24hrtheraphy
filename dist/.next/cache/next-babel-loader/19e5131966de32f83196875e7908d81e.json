People affected by this disorder have a distorted view of their own appearance, and generally tend to fixate on elements of their face or body that they believe are unattractive or ‘wrong’. Because of those core beliefs, they generally tend to spend a significant time worried about their appearance, however body dysmorphia disorder is a serious mental health condition, consequently sufferers are not merely vain or self-obsessed. If you find yourself continuously comparing your appearance to others, spending numerous times looking to hide supposed personal defects, or becoming distressed by a certain area of your body, you may be suffering from body dysmorphia disorder.</p>\n                        <p>Other symptoms include:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                          <li>Spending lots of time in the front of the mirror or steering clear of mirrors altogether</li>\n                          <li>Feeling worried whilst around other people and averting social situations</li>\n                          <li>Being overly worried regarding requesting help of fear that they’ll be seen to be self-obsessed</li>\n                          <li>Seeking clinical remedy for the perceived defect which include cosmetic surgical procedure</li>\n                          <li>Excessive food regimen and exercise</li>\n                        </ul>\n                        <p>Although BDD is different to OCD, there are similarities between the 2 problems, as each involve compulsive behaviours.

A compulsion is a repetitive behaviour (that could additionally be mental) that a person feels they must perform to calm the obsessive thoughts.</p>\n                        <p>The regular cycle of OCD is as follows:</p>\n                        <ul>\n                          <li>Obsessions – in which an unwanted image, photo or urge repeatedly enters your thoughts</li>\n                          <li>Anxiety – the obsession provokes severe tension and distress</li>\n                          <li>Compulsion – repetitive behaviours or intellectual acts are performed to relieve the distress or tension</li>\n                          <li>Temporary relief – the compulsive behaviour brings brief comfort, but the anxiety and obsession soon go back</li>\n                        </ul>\n                        <p>Obsessions and compulsions differ among individuals; however, a few not unusual obsessions consist of worry about infection, harming yourself or others, or obsessions of perfection. Sometimes obsessions and compulsions are related, so a person with a fear of contamination may be forced to repeatedly wash their hands, however compulsions also can be totally unrelated, consisting of tapping a foot again and again.</p>\n                        <p>The severity of OCD symptoms can range greatly.

The unpleasantness and severity of their signs and symptoms can make it very hard for sufferers to go about their day-to-day lives.
